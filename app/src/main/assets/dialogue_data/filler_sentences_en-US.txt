Let me think.
I’ll reflect for a moment.
Just a moment.
Let’s see…
Ah, I’m forming an idea.
I need a moment.
I’m gathering the information.
I’m focusing.
I’m working on a response.
Let me reflect…
I’m trying to understand.
I’m weighing the options.
I’m thinking intensely.
I’m reflecting carefully.
I’m pondering.
I’m collecting my thoughts.
I’m analyzing carefully.
I’m trying to find an answer.
I’m considering the different perspectives.
I’m reflecting on the options.
I’m trying to understand better.
I’m reflecting on your request.
I’m trying to come up with a coherent answer.
I’m examining this carefully.
I’m evaluating it carefully.
I’m reflecting on the matter.
I’m pondering the various options.
I’m analyzing the information carefully.
I’m trying to fully understand.
I’m reflecting on the situation.
So, let’s see…
Let’s see… What can I say?
I could think about it for a moment.
I’m still undecided.
Ah… I’m still questioning.
I’m still undecided.
Um… I’m still reflecting.
Oh… Let me think.
I’m still reflecting.
